Open Home Brewing Automation
=======================

The goal of this project is to define plans for an completely automated home brewing system.

This project draws inspiration from other DYI OpenSource projects such as...

[Open Window Framing](https://github.com/luke0x/open-window-farming)
[OpenSource Ecology](https://github.com/OSE)

## What is Open Source Home Brewing Automation?

Home brewing is fun, but it's alot of work. My brew sessions are between 4 to 8 hours includeing clean up. A good amount of that time is spend just waiting for your wart to hit the right tempature or just waiting for things to cool down. Woudn't it be nice to automate some of these processess, or how about all of them?

## The Ultimate Goal

The grand vision is a completely automated how brewing setup. Just add grains and yeast, wait for a couple of weeks, then you have beer. The features of grand vision system.

1. Precise control of tempature throughout the process
1. Automated cleaning cycle
1. Built from off the shelf parts
1. Near realtime measurement of key parameters (temp, gravity) throughout the fermentation process
1. From grains and yeast to beer (all you need to care about is adding the grains and yeast. Everthing else is automated until the beer is feremented and read to keg or bottle.
